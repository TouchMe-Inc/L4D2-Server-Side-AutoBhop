# Server-Side AutoBhop
A plugin for SourceMod for L4D2, which allows you to autobhop.

1. Works **individually** for each player (When you activate autobhop, only you will autobhop and no one else)
2. Checks for admin rights (Z flag - root)
3. Notifies you in the chat that autobhop is enabled (No one will see this message except you)
4. No Dependencies :D

# How to use?
Just type in chat **!bhop** or **/bhop**, or you can activate it through console using - **sm_bhop**

## Enjoy!
